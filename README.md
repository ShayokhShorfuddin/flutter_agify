# flutter_agify

A Flutter package that grabs data from the Agify.io api that can predict your age using your name!

**NOTE:** I would like to make it clear that **I don't own the Agify.io api and the only purpose of this package is to make using Agify.io api easy.**

## API Website

Here is the official API Website of Agify.io -
https://agify.io/

## How To Use

`flutter_agify` offers 4 functions to grab information from  Agify.io API response. They are -
â€ƒ

```dart
getAge() // For grabbing age data of 1 name. "name" parameter is required and "apiKey" parameter is optional.
```
```dart
getAges() // For grabbing age data of a list of names. "names" parameter is required and "apiKey" parameter is optional.
```
```dart
getAgeWithCountry() // For grabbing age data of 1 name but providing a country. "name" and "country" parameter is required and "apiKey" parameter is optional.
```
```dart
getAgesWithCountry() // For grabbing age data of a list of names but providing a country. "names" and "country" parameter is required and "apiKey" parameter is optional.
```

* If you need to check more than 1000 names/day, you need to obtain an API key. For getting API key, visit https://store.agify.io/

* **NOTE:** If you are about to use ```getAgeWithCountry()``` or ```getAgesWithCountry()```, keep in mind that the Agify.io api follows `ISO 3166-1 alpha-2` for country codes. See https://agify.io/our-data for a list of all supported countries. :]


## Return Types

* ```getAge()``` returns a **Map** that looks like this - ```{"Name": _name, "Age": age, "Count": count}``` or it will throw an error if the API responded with an error.
&nbsp;
* ```getAges()``` returns ```jsonDecode(apiResponse.body)``` which is a **List** of **Maps** which contains the age data of every single person name you provided to the API as List. It can also throw an error if the API responded with an error.
&nbsp;
* ```getAgeWithCountry()``` returns a **Map** that looks like this - ```{"Name": _name, "Age": age, "Count": count, "Country": _country};``` or it will throw an error if the API responded with an error.
&nbsp;
* ```getAgesWithCountry()``` returns ```jsonDecode(apiResponse.body)``` which is a **List** of **Maps** which contains the age data of every single person name you provided to the API as List. It can also throw an error if the API responded with an error.


## Code Example

A piece of code that uses getAge() -

```dart
class homepage extends StatefulWidget {
  const homepage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  State<homepage> createState() => _homepageState();
}

class _homepageState extends State<homepage> {
  Future<dynamic>? target;

  @override
  void initState() {
    target = getAge(name: "Peter");
    super.initState();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
        body: Center(
      child: FutureBuilder<dynamic>(
          future: target,
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
              if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text(
                  '${snapshot.error} occured',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 19, color: Colors.white),
                );
              } else if (snapshot.hasData) {
                final data = snapshot.data;
                return Container(
                  alignment: Alignment.center,
                  height: 400,
                  width: 600,
                  color: Color(0xFF12202F),
                  child: Text(
                    "Predicted age of ${data["Name"]} is ${data["Age"]}",
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 19, color: Colors.white),
                  ),
                );
              }
            }
            return SizedBox(
              height: 50,
              width: 50,
              child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
            );
          }),
    ));
  }
}
